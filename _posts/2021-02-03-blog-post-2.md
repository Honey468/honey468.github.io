The least common multiple, or LCM, is another number that's useful in solving many math problems. Let's find the LCM of 30 and 45. One way to find the least common multiple of two numbers is to first list the prime factors of each number. 30 = 2 × 3 × 5.

How to Find LCM by Listing Multiples
------
 * List the multiples of each number until at least one of the multiples appears on all lists
 * Find the smallest number that is on all of the lists
 * This number is the LCM
Example: LCM(6,7,21)
 * Multiples of 6: 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60
 * Multiples of 7: 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 56, 63
 * Multiples of 21: 21, 42, 63
 * Find the smallest number that is on all of the lists. We have it in bold above.
 * So LCM(6, 7, 21) is 42

How to Find LCM Using the Cake Method (Ladder Method)
------
 The cake method uses division to find the LCM of a set of numbers. People use the cake or ladder method as the fastest and easiest way to find the LCM because it is simple division.

The cake method is the same as the ladder method, the box method, the factor box method and the grid method of shortcuts to find the LCM. The boxes and grids might look a little different, but they all use division by primes to find LCM.

Find the LCM(10, 12, 15, 75)

Write down your numbers in a cake layer (row)

![Cake layer(row)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hridaya423/hridaya423.github.io/master/images/Cake%20Ladder%20.jpg)   

Divide the layer numbers by a prime number that is evenly divisible into two or more numbers in the layer and bring down the result into the next layer.

![Divide layer numbers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hridaya423/hridaya423.github.io/master/images/Cake%20Ladder%201.jpg)   
             
If any number in the layer is not evenly divisible just bring down that number.

Continue dividing cake layers by prime numbers.
When there are no more primes that evenly divided into two or more numbers you are done.

The LCM is the product of the numbers in the L shape, left column and bottom row. 1 is ignored.
LCM = 2 × 3 × 5 × 2 × 5
LCM = 300
Therefore, LCM(10, 12, 15, 75) = 300

How to Find the LCM Using the Division Method
------

Find the LCM(10, 18, 25)

  * Write down your numbers in a top table row
  
  ![Step 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hridaya423/hridaya423.github.io/master/images/Division%20Table.jpg)   

  * Starting with the lowest prime numbers, divide the row of numbers by a prime number that is evenly divisible into at least one of your numbers and bring down the result  into the next table row.
  
  ![Step 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hridaya423/hridaya423.github.io/master/images/Division%20Table%201.jpg) 

  * If any number in the row is not evenly divisible just bring down that number.
  
  ![Step 3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hridaya423/hridaya423.github.io/master/images/Division%20Table%202.jpg) 

  * Continue dividing rows by prime numbers that divide evenly into at least one number.
  * When the last row of results is all 1's you are done.
  
  ![Step 4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hridaya423/hridaya423.github.io/master/images/Division%20Table%203.jpg) 

The LCM is the product of the prime numbers in the first column.
LCM = 2 × 3 × 3 × 5 × 5
LCM = 450
Therefore, LCM(10, 18, 25) = 450

How to Find LCM by GCF
------

The formula to find the LCM using the Greatest Common Factor GCF of a set of numbers is:

LCM(a,b) = (a×b)/GCF(a,b)

Example: Find LCM(6,10)

Find the GCF(6,10) = 2
Use the LCM by GCF formula to calculate (6×10)/2 = 60/2 = 30
So LCM(6,10) = 30
A factor is a number that results when you can evenly divide one number by another. In this sense, a factor is also known as a divisor.

The greatest common factor of two or more numbers is the largest number shared by all the factors.

The greatest common factor GCF is the same as:
 * HCF - Highest Common Factor
 * GCD - Greatest Common Divisor
 * HCD - Highest Common Divisor
 * GCM - Greatest Common Measure
 * HCM - Highest Common Measure

How to Find LCM of Decimal Numbers
------
* Find the number with the most decimal places
* Count the number of decimal places in that number. Let's call that number D.
* For each of your numbers move the decimal D places to the right. All numbers will become integers.
* Find the LCM of the set of integers
* For your LCM, move the decimal D places to the left. This is the LCM for your original set of decimal numbers.

Properties of LCM
------
* The LCM is associative:
 * LCM(a, b) = LCM(b, a)

* The LCM is commutative:
  * LCM(a, b, c) = LCM(LCM(a, b), c) = LCM(a, LCM(b, c))

 * The LCM is distributive:
   * LCM(da, db, dc) = dLCM(a, b, c)

 * The LCM is related to the greatest common factor (GCF):
    * LCM(a,b) = a × b / GCF(a,b) and
    * GCF(a,b) = a × b / LCM(a,b)
