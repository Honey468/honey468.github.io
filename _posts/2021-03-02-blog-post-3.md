I’ve made this image by multiple images of starfish⭐, Crocodiles🐊, Water snakes 🐍, Turtles🐢 , Jellyfish, Squid🦑 , Octopus🐙, Shrimps🦐 , Seahorse, Clams🐚 , Crabs🦀 , Seals, Flying fish 🦈 , Dolphins 🐬, Whales🐋 , Shipping 🚤🛥️ 🛳️⛴️, Yachting⛵🚤 , Scuba diving🤿 , Surfing🏄🏻‍♀️🏄🏻‍♂️ , Fishing🎣, Swimming 🏊🏻‍♀️ 🏊🏻‍♂️ , water games 🤽‍♀️🤽🏻‍♂️ In the ice cold water? 🥶🥽💧💦🧊, fictional mermaids🧜🏻‍♀️🧜🏻‍♂️, Or water dragons! ….

About Water Dragons: I think that water dragons are alive in deep water, Some water dragons are sweet & noble. Whereas, some are dangerous, ruin everything..

About Water Games: I think that water games are amazing as we enjoy sliding upon the water, water sports.....

About Scooba Diving: Scooba Diving is very fun and bad also.. As we can go into the seas, oceans and see the beautiful fishes and sea creatures, And if a shark comes while we do scooba diving it can be dangerous for our lives......

About Swimming: Swimming is fun and also bad as I feel, Because if we don't know swimming properly we can just drown in the water, and it's fun too as we can just float ourselves in water and that's something fun.

About surfing: Surfing is good and also bad as I feel, Because as we do surfing in seas and oceans, If we don't know surfing we go and practice in a sea or an ocean so we can just drown and give our live, and it's fun also as you can enjoy it in high waves and we can feel the air...


About Yachting: Yachting is something cool, you go on a yacht and enjoy it...

About Shipping: Shipping is something very mindblowing, as we can have a big ship then and it's with rooms, kitchen, dance room, swimming pool Then it's called a cruise that is also a type of ship too..

About Crocodiles: Crocodiles are dangerous, as they are carnivorous and they can eat us, or any other creature...

About Flying fish: I don't know much about flying fishes but they are really cool creatures, as they can fly also but have a shape of fish...

About Seals: Seals are cute creatures, who make a melodious tune to communicate to other seals....

About Cliff Jumping: Cliff jumping is something very outstanding and something very dangerous too, As if we jump from a cliff we can just fall into a open shark's mouth😁😋 as we jump from a cliff and usually cliffs are located near seasides and it's cool as we feel a cool splash when we reach the water...

About Fishing: Fishing is good and bad, because I feel as a vegetarian if we do fishing we would do vomiting by the smell of the fish.. and it's good for the non-vegetarians as they can eat fresh delivered fish without any preservatives and chemicals...

About Sea Horse: Sea horses are amazing creatures. They make a good tune and they have a cool shape....

About Octopus: Octopuses have 8 legs and are big creatures some are kind and some are dangerous...

About Whale: Whales are of many types but in the image, I have put a killer whale, the other type of whale I know is the blue whale

About StarFish: Starfish do not have bones, that's why they are like slime.....

About Jelly Fish: Jellyfish are also like starfishes, they don't have bones and are cool and amazing creatures as I feel...

About Crab: Crabs are dangerous mostly as they have sharp hands and they can bite us and that can be poisonous

About Sharks: Sharks are dangerous creatures as they can kill us, and they have a very good sense of smell...

About turtles: Turtles are outstanding creatures I feel, They swim very well and are small cute creatures...
